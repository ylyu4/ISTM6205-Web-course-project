### Chapter 3 [HTML 1], Project 2 [Book CRM]

Hands-on practice projects are present in many chapters throughout this textbook
and relate the content matter back to a few overarching examples: an art store, a
travel website, and a customer relationship management (CRM) portal for a book
representative. These projects come with images, databases, and other files, and are
included with your purchase of this textbook.

This project is the first step in the creation of a CRM (Customer Relations
Management) website. In this project, you will be augmenting the provided page to
use semantic HTML5 tags.
