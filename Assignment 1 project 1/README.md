# Fundamentals of Web Development, 2nd Edition
### Chapter 3 [HTML 1], Project 1 [Travel]

Hands-on practice projects are present in many chapters throughout this textbook
and relate the content matter back to a few overarching examples: an art store, a
travel website, and a customer relationship management (CRM) portal for a book
representative. These projects come with images, databases, and other files, and are
included with your purchase of this textbook.

This project is the first step in the creation of a travel photo-sharing website. The
page you are given is augmented by this project so that it appears similar to that
shown in Figure 3.28.
